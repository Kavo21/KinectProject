# KinectProject
In this project, I developed a system based on Microsoft Kinect and integrated five components, physical movement recognition, speech recognition, emotion recognition, direction recognition, and object recognition. The purpose of this project is to help the learner use the technique device to improve their English ability and train pronunciation.

This mechanism helps the learners go through the meaning of vocabularies through physical movements. We designed two main modules in our system. One is the learning module, and
another is kinesthetic recognition mechanism. For the experimental group, a two-person cooperation mode is adopted, on the other hand, a single play mode is adopted for the control group. 

In the hardware deployment framework, each learner has one computer、KinectV2、screen and headset. In addition, we use the database to store the learner's learning behavior and
construct a server for data transfer so that learners can cooperate and interact in the activities.
